Project Title: Netflix Clone with React and Axios
Project Overview:
In this project, you will be building a simplified version of the Netflix user interface using React for the frontend and Axios for making API requests to fetch movie or TV show data from a public API (such as The Movie Database API).

Key Features:
Homepage:

Display a grid of popular movies or TV shows on the homepage.
Each item in the grid should include a thumbnail, title, and a brief description.
Navigation:

Implement a navigation bar with sections like Home, TV Shows, Movies, and My List.
Allow users to navigate between these sections.
Movie/TV Show Details:

When a user clicks on a movie or TV show, display detailed information about it.
Show additional details such as release date, genres, and a longer description.
Search Functionality:

Implement a search bar that allows users to search for movies or TV shows.
Display search results dynamically as the user types.
User Authentication (Optional):

Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts and log in.
Personalize the experience by creating a "My List" feature where users can add/remove movies or TV shows.
Responsive Design:

Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
Tech Stack:
Frontend:

React (functional components, hooks)
Axios for making API requests
React Router for navigation
CSS (or a preprocessor like SCSS) for styling
API:

Utilize a public movie/TV show API like The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
Development Steps:
Set Up the Project:

Use Create React App or set up your React project manually.
Install necessary dependencies like Axios.
Design the UI:

Create the basic layout for the homepage, navigation bar, and movie/TV show details.
Fetch Data:

Use Axios to fetch data from the chosen API.
Handle API responses and update the state accordingly.
Implement Navigation:

Set up React Router for navigation between different sections.
Search Functionality:

Implement search functionality using the API.
User Authentication (Optional):

Implement user authentication if desired.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the application is visually appealing and functional on various devices.
Learning Goals:
Gain hands-on experience with React components, state, and hooks.
Learn how to make asynchronous API requests using Axios.
Practice routing in a React application.
Understand the basics of responsive web design.
Resources:
React Documentation
Axios Documentation
The Movie Database API
Feel free to customize the project based on your preferences and expand its features as you become more comfortable with React and web development.
